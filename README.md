This project is a fully responsive personal portfolio website that I designed and developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My aim was to create a clean, modern, and professional online presence that showcases my skills, highlights my projects, and reflects my identity as a front-end developer.

The website starts with a smooth navigation bar for quick access to each section, followed by a bold and engaging hero section that introduces me in a clear and impactful way. I built a dedicated Skills section to present my technical expertise, and an About Me section to share my background, strengths, and passion for creative front-end development.

The Projects section is designed to be interactive and visually appealing, allowing users to explore the work I’ve completed with clarity and detail. At the end of the website, the Footer section includes my contact details, social media links, and a copyright note—giving the portfolio a complete and polished finish.

To make the website accessible on all devices, I ensured it is fully responsive, using flexbox, grid layouts, and a clean code structure. JavaScript is added to improve interactivity, user engagement, and overall smoothness of the browsing experience
